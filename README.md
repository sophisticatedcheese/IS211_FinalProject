# Blog App
IS211_FinalProject

The purpose of this web application is to give a user the ability to run their own blog. A blog is just a
series of posts made by an author. Each post has a title, a published date, an author, and textual
(HTML) content. When first loading the application at the root URL, the user should be presented with a
list of available posts listed in reverse chronological order (newest posts first). The application should
allow a user to login via the ‘/login’ URL, which gives that user the ability to make changes to the blog.
